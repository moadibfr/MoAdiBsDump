        <p>As I tried to play Dungeon Keeper (mainly because it was a top app on the Google Play Store, I admit I didn't play the old version) I got really (really !!) annoyed by everithing taking so long (24h to clear a fucking block !!) so I searched for others opinion on the inernet.<br/>
I found this Youtube Video which really hit the spot and is quite funny so I thought it may be a good share.</p>
