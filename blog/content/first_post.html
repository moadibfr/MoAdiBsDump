          Yes, I now... This is at least the 5th times I rebuild Le Petit Monde from scratch and I always let it down few months after... <br/>
          But I kind of like it and as it's my very own playground I think I'll continue to play with it! :D <br/>
          This time I'm using Pelican which is basically the same thing as Octopress (which I liked a lot) but written in Python. As I'm more fluent in this language than I'm in ruby I decided to switch. I'm not going to import old post from octopress as they are quite useless... <br/>
          I may update this blog a few time but I won't make any promess as I'm too lazy to keep them.<br/>
          Btw, I think the source for everything here will be on my github anytime soon so if you are interested keep a eye for it.
