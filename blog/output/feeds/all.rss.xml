        &lt;p&gt;As I tried to play Dungeon Keeper (mainly because it was a top app on the Google Play Store, I admit I didn't play the old version) I got really (really !!) annoyed by everithing taking so long (24h to clear a fucking block !!) so I searched for others opinion on the inernet.&lt;br /&gt;
I found this Youtube Video which really hit the spot and is quite funny so I thought it may be a good share.&lt;/p&gt;

          Yes, I now... This is at least the 5th times I rebuild Le Petit Monde from scratch and I always let it down few months after... &lt;br /&gt;
          But I kind of like it and as it's my very own playground I think I'll continue to play with it! :D &lt;br /&gt;
          This time I'm using Pelican which is basically the same thing as Octopress (which I liked a lot) but written in Python. As I'm more fluent in this language than I'm in ruby I decided to switch. I'm not going to import old post from octopress as they are quite useless... &lt;br /&gt;
          I may update this blog a few time but I won't make any promess as I'm too lazy to keep them.&lt;br /&gt;
          Btw, I think the source for everything here will be on my github anytime soon so if you are interested keep a eye for it.
        &lt;/p&gt;
